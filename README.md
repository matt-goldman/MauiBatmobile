# MauiBatmobile

Work in progress. Demonstrates creating drawn controls with [Microsoft.Maui.Graphics](https://github.com/dotnet/Microsoft.Maui.Graphics).    
    
`Microsoft.Maui.Grpahics` is still listed as 'experimental', so there are a couple of kinks in this (but they're well hidden).    
    
Additionally, I've used the wrong gRPC library so currently only works on Windows; I will fix this soon.
