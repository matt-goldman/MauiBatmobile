Send telemetry from the Batmobile to the Batcave! Ensure the send and receive switches are on respectively, then use the throttle. Current throttle telemetry will be sent to the Batcave and shown on the Batcomputer!

Demonstrates creating drawn controls with [Microsoft.Maui.Graphics](https://github.com/dotnet/Microsoft.Maui.Graphics).    
    
`Microsoft.Maui.Grpahics` is still listed as 'experimental', so there are a couple of kinks in this (but they're well hidden).    
    
Additionally, I've used the wrong gRPC library so currently only works on Windows; I will fix this soon.
